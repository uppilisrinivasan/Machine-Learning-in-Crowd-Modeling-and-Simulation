Course Overview
The course covers the following topics:

1) Mathematical Models for Crowd Dynamics: Foundational techniques for modeling crowd behavior.
2) Machine Learning Applications: Use of ML techniques such as PCA, neural networks, and time-delay embedding for crowd simulation.
3) Advanced Techniques: Application of methods like diffusion maps, function approximation, and Koopman operator analysis in the context of crowd behavior.
4) Practical Implementation: Hands-on coding exercises and simulations to model and predict crowd interactions.

Key Features
1) Exploration of crowd dynamics using machine learning techniques.
2) Implementation of time-delay embedding for advanced modeling.
3) Use of neural networks and dimensionality reduction techniques to analyze and predict pedestrian movement.
4) Integration of data visualization tools for effective representation of results.
